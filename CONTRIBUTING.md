# Contributing to the repository

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

+ Reporting a bug or error
+ Discussing the current state of the repository
+ Submitting a fix or improvement
+ Proposing new features

## We use Github

We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions)

All code changes happen through pull requests (PR). PRs are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1) Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2) If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3) Ensure the test suite passes.
4) Issue that pull request!

## All contributions you make are subject to the same license as the repository

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the [GNU General Public License, Version 3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html), the license that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs/errors using Github's [issues](https://github.com/TomfromBerlin/bashrc/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs and errors. Report such things by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/TomfromBerlin/bashrc/issues/new/choose); it's that easy!

## Write reports with detail, background, and sample code (if necessary)

At first, check if there is an [open issue](https://github.com/TomfromBerlin/bashrc/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc) related to your issue

**Great Reports** tend to have:

+ A quick summary and/or background
+ Steps to reproduce
  + Be specific!
  + Give sample code if you can
+ What you expected would happen
+ What actually happens
+ Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

+ Make your code as readable as possible
+ Comment your changes inside the code!
