# topcmd

<details>
  <summary> The topcmd function provides a convenient way to analyze and display frequently used commands in a shell session or command history. </summary>

## Description

The function starts with a conditional statement that checks if the first argument ($1) is empty. If it is, it means no argument was provided, and the function proceeds to display the most frequently used commands in the current session.

If an argument is provided, the function uses a case statement to handle different argument options. The following options are supported:

 `-v` - Displays the most frequently used commands divided by the provided arguments.

 `-vx` - Displays the most frequently used commands in the entire command history divided by the provided arguments.

 `-c` - Displays an example configuration for the history function.

 `-h` or `--help` - Displays detailed usage instructions and examples.

Within the topcmd function, there are several nested functions (topcmd_invalid, topcmd_help, and history_conf) that are used to display help information and example configurations.

The main logic of the topcmd function involves using the history command and awk to process and count the commands. The output is then formatted and displayed using various shell commands (grep, sort, nl, head, column) to achieve a tabular representation of the data.

Depending on the argument option, the function either uses the history command to analyze the current session or uses the fc command to analyze the entire command history stored in a file specified by the $HISTFILE environment variable.

The function uses ANSI escape sequences to format and colorize the output, providing visual cues and highlighting important information.
