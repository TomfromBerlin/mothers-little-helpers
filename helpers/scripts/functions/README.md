## Usage

If you want to use these functions, download the file(s) you want or copy the code into a new file and save it in a folder in your `$fpath` or wherever your functions are located.

Some or most of these files are intended to be run in a Z shell environment. Further instructions about its usage can be found in the files themselves.

Some of these functions are automatic functions, so to speak, i.e. they are executed when a certain condition is met, e.g. `chpwd` is executed when a directory change takes place.
