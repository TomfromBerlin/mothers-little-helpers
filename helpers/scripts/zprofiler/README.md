# zprofiler function

<details><summary> 
  
  ## Summary:
  
  The code checks for
  - the presence of a Z shell configuration file (~/.zshrc),
  - the required lines in the file,
  - commented lines,
  - and provides instructions for changing the file if necessary.
  
  The purpose of this code is to ensure that the Z shell is properly configured for profiling. If this is the case, profiling is started.
  
  ## Usage:
  
  Copy this file into a folder that is part of $fpath and restart your Z shell (e.g., open a new terminal window). Then call the function by simply typing "zprofiler" into the command line. This is much easier to remember and faster to type than `ZPROF=1 zsh -i -c exit`.
  </summary>

  The first part of the code checks if the file ~/.zshrc exists. If it does not exist, it prints a message indicating that the file is missing and asks if Z shell is installed. Then it exits with a status code of 1.
  
  The second part is the actual function.
  
  1. The _file variable is set to $HOME/.zshrc, which represents the path to the users Z shell configuration file.
  
  2. The _search1 and _search2 variables store two different search patterns 
  
     `[ -z "$ZPROF" ] || zmodload zsh/zprof` and `[ -z "$ZPROF" ] || zprof`
  
     that will be used to find the corresponding lines in the Z shell configuration file.
    
  3. If the patterns were __*not*__ found in the configuration file, it prints a message indicating that the required lines need to be added at the beginning and end of the configuration file. If only one of patterns is __*not*__ found, it prints a message indicating that the respective line needs to be added either at the beginning or end of the configuration file.
  
  4. If the patterns are found, the code checks if any of the lines with the patterns are commented out (lines starting with #). If so, it prints a message indicating that the line is commented out and advises to remove the leading # character from the line.
    
  5. If any of the patterns are commented out or not found, a message will be displayed indicating that changes need to be made to enable Z shell profiling and the script will exit without starting profiling.
  
  6. Otherwise, the environment variable __ZPROF__ is set to __1__ and the command `zsh -i -c exit` is executed, which starts profiling.
